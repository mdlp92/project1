<h1>potato<sup>TV</sup> KIEI project</h1>

The goal of this startup is to create a social platform that centers around content (TV shows and Movies) and people’s reactions to them. This platform would build value by having people provide their feedback or “recommendations” for certain shows across platforms and allow friends and followers to see what their friends are watching, what they liked, and what they didn’t.

Movies & TV shows are great when you watch them with your friends. Potato TV creates digital living rooms that allow you to hangout with your friends while watching the shows & movies you love, all from the comfort of your home. Whether you are across town or across the world, Potato TV connects you from the couch.
